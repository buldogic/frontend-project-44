# Hello! Welcome to the Brain Games!

## **_Description:_**

Brain Games is a set of five console games built on the principle of popular mobile applications for brain training. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, it is considered that the game is over. Incorrect answers end the game and offer to go through it again.

## **_Installing instructions:_**

Just clone this repository to your machine using 'git clone <ssh/url>'. Open a 'frontend-project-44' directory, then enter 'make install' and 'npm link' in your console. Congratulations! Now you are ready to play.
